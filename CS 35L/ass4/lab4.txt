1. I downloaded the anonymous clone from the git repository.
Using the command:
$git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

2.
I go in to the directory:
$cd diffutils
and then create the log:
$git log > git-log.txt

3. 
$git tag -l > git-tags.txt


4. I opened the git-log file and looked up the commit, the number is 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f, made by Professor Eggert,
and generated a patch and saved it to quote-patch.txt:
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. 
$git checkout v3.0
$patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt



6. I used Emacs to revert all the changed except c files, 
and go to each files and revert the changes by looking 
at the diff. it seems that the program changed ` to ‘

7. I removed all the untracked files by using:
$git clean -n  
and
$git clean -f 
and then git status showed me about the status of the repository. 

8. used git diff to generate a quote-3.0-patch and checked “diff . -“
and “./diff —help” so that to make sure it’s fixed.

9. I download diffuil to another directory and I went through some files. 
The files aren’t identical (obviously), but most files are identical because 
the patch didn’t change them. the files showed
 some differences between the .c files
