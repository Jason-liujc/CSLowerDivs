Q1. Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"? 
Was it necessary to remove that line? Explain.

It was removed because there is an identical case above it. It was removed to:
1. clean up the code.
2. to make the code less confusing.
3. prevent runtime situation when the code might go through the repeated case. 


Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils 
instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for?
Might this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems 
with your application, perhaps in countries where users don't 
speak English and don't understand English-format dates?

There are other commands in the GNU core utilities might behave 
similar to the ls command bug. So we have to watch 
out for it (the time format). 

Also users from different countries might have different
habit on time format which might confuse users from different places.




Q3. What happens when this script is invoked 
on an empty file like /dev/null, and why?

It says “index error: list index out of range”. 
The reason is that the program randomly chose a line 
and we the program try to access the sequence, 
because the content list’s length is zero, and 
therefore it’s out of range. 



Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with 
Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why? (You can 
run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by using the 
command python3 instead of python.)

It gives an error at the IOError line because the 
syntax of that part changed in Python 3 comparing 
to 2. It should be “except IOError as err”
