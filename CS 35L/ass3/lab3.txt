1. I followed the instructions and downloaded Coreutils 7.6
 from the website, using:
$wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

and I extracted the package inside tar using:
$tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

	Then I made a file for this coreutil assignment:
$mkdir coreU
	and then I proceeded to read the documentation in configure 
to understand this coreutil thing and Brady’s patch, which does
change to ls.c, which seems to be the correct patch since we 
are fixing the ls command. 


2. I used the command:
$./configure —prefix=/u/eng/class/classliu/coreU
to configure my package to a certain directory. 

$make

$make install prefix=/u/eng/class/classliu 
and install into that directory.


3. 
Checking the core util command by going into the right directory and type:
$./ls -l 

I get outputs like:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classliu class  72689 2015-10-16 00:18 yes

confirms the bug.


4.
Then I did:


$patch -p1 < my.patch

to apply the patch. p1 is the default for git apply.




5. Then I used touch to create a file and make it an year old.

$touch -t 1401251107 oldfile 
to create an oldfile that a year old.

Then I used ls -l on the file and it finally provided the correct format.
