Log for lab 8


I first cd'ed to the right directory and check for the sort version:

$sort --version





$od -An -f -N 4000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > test.txt

to generate 4M bytes of random numbers and put it in test.txt


I removed the white spaces using:
tr -s ' ' '\n' | sed '1d' > test2.txt
this command. 

Then I used od -c test2.txt




I use the option â€”parallel to run multithreads:


for each number of threads I ran:

$time -p sort -g --parallel=<NUM> test2.txt > /dev/null

where NUM is a integer of number of threads. 


Here are the results:

NUM=1:

real 93.39
user 101.27
sys 0.15

NUM=2:

real 66.44
user 119.30
sys 0.22

NUM=4:
real 31.99
user 140.31
sys 0.40


NUM=8:
real 29.16
user 143.99
sys 0.88


As one can see, the real time decreases as we increase the number of threads.
For the user and the system, the time increases as we increases the number of threads. 
This makes sense because we are using more of the CPU when using more threads. 
Generally, multithread sorting makes the sorting faster but more 
resource consuming as well.
