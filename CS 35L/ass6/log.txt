I used the following command to install the SSH tools:
$sudo apt-get update

$sudo apt-get install openssh-server

$sudo apt-get install openssh-client

As an admin,

I did :


$sudo useradd -d /home/name -m name  (create a new user)

$sudo passwd name (create password)

cd to directory

$sudo mkdir .ssh (create a directory where we store the IDs)

$sudo chown -R name.ssh (change the ownership of the ID)

$sudo chmod 700 .ssh  (gives permission)





As a client:

ssh -keygen (create keys)

ping the server to see if it responds 

ssh-copy-id -i Username@address (copies the public key)

ssh -add (register the private key with the user)

ssh -X Username@address (see if we can remotely access it)
