Lab5

1.
I use wget to get the package:
$wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall15/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
 and used 
$tar -zxvf “filename”
went into the folder and entered:
./configure CFLAGS='-g3 -O0'

2. 
Used make but it gave me 

 so I went to get the patch from the website, coreutil.diff. 

3. 
$patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
and make it again and it works

4.
then I put:
$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
$ cd
$ rm -fr $tmp

at the command 




5.
Now we try to get rid of the bug. I put a break point in sort_files 
and compare_time and traced the variables. I eventually 
discovered that all these functions leads to the timespect 
function. So the bug probably comes from the timespec file so
I went into it’s implementation and discovered 
that the is the variable int diff. 
It overflows during the
 subtraction, so I went on to fix it. 


6.

I went into the library folder and opened up using emacs time_cpm.h
 file and changed the implementation of the header.
I use:
$diff -u timespec.h newtime.h > lab5.diff.
Then I applied the patch and see the problem is fixed. I then added the
changelog


Answer some questions:

1. The make didn’t work because there’s a problem in timespec.h
 which I fixed.


2. When I try to reproduce the problem, the sensate can handle
 this because the they are machine of different bits. The Seasnet
 use 64 bits and NFS use 32 bits. There’s bits lost during the conversion.
