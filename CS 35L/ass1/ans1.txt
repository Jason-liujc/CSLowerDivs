Disclaimer: I'm using my personal linux machine so the files under 
/usr or /bin/ might be different from the linux server. 


1.How can you get man to print all the commands that have a specific
word in their man page?

 By using: 
$ man -k keyword


2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system?

use the whereis command: 
cp: /bin/cp 	 /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz
wc: /usr/bin/wc		/usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz


3. What executable programs have names that are 
just one character long, and what do they do?

w is a command that  displays  information  about the users currently on 
the machine and their processes.

. (bash_builtins)is command that run a command script in the current shell 
(source: http://ss64.com/bash/)


4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic
link /usr/bin/cc, which file actually is executed?

$ file /usr/bin/cc
/usr/bin/cc: symbolic link to `gcc'

It links to gcc. And gcc is located in /usr/bin/gcc



5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. 
What does the symbolic mode g-s mean, in terms of permissions?

g: group's permission
-: take away permission; it takes away the mode bits previously used
s: user or group set-ID


6. What option to find lets you search for files 
that have been modified in the last 3 days?

$ find . -type f -mtime 3
should be sufficient. 
"-mtime n" means "Fileâ€™s  data was last modified n*24 hours ago."
"-type f" means we only search for regular files. 


7. Use the previous answer to find all 
directories modified in the last 3 days.

change type to d (directory)
$ find . -type d -mtime 3


8. Of the files in the same directory as find, 
how many of them are symbolic links?

I went to find's directory, and typed:
$ ls -l 

About 30 of them are symbolic (I used my own linux computer,
installed a bunch of GNU related package so it'll probably
be different from the Linux server) 


9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory?

I used the command:
$ ls -t 
with most old at bottom; and at the bottom is a file called "pymodules"


10. Where does the locale command get its data from?

locale: /usr/bin/locale 
/usr/lib/locale 
/usr/include/locale.h 
/usr/share/locale /usr/share/man/man1/locale.1.gz 
/usr/share/man/man1p/locale.1p.gz 
/usr/share/man/man3/locale.3pm.gz 
/usr/share/man/man5/locale.5.gz 
/usr/share/man/man7/locale.7.gz


11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name?

I used auto-completion, and the results are:
I used "whereis -sort" and "whereis sort-"

sort-columns 
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs 
sort-regexp-fields 
Buffer-menu-sort                       Buffer-menu-sort-by-column
ibuffer-invert-sorting                 ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode
rmail-sort-by-author                   rmail-sort-by-correspondent
rmail-sort-by-date                     rmail-sort-by-labels
rmail-sort-by-lines                    rmail-sort-by-recipient
rmail-sort-by-subject


12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-a through C-z do? 
Can you list their actions concisely?

C-a : Moves to the beginning of the current line.
C-b: Backward char
C-c: shell related commands
C-e: end of the line
C-f: forward char
C-g: stop current command
C-h: Command help
C-k: Kill line
C-l: recenter
C-n: Next line 
C-p: previous line
C-r: isearch-backward
C-s: isearch-forward
C-t: Transpose char
C-v: scroll up
C-w: Kill region
C-x: set-fill-prefix
C-y: Yank
C-z: suspend emacs




13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?

C-g: quit, cancel running or parially running command. 
Here's CMU's explanation :

 "Quitting with `C-g' is used for getting rid of a partially typed
command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.  It also stops a
running command in the middle in a relatively safe way, so you can use
it if you accidentally give a command which takes a long time.  In
particular, it is safe to quit out of killing; either your text will
*all* still be in the buffer, or it will *all* be in the kill ring (or
maybe both).  Quitting an incremental search does special things
documented under searching; in general, it may take two successive
`C-g' characters to get out of a search."

It's similar to a Ctrl-c in some compilers where it just stops running programs.


14. What does the Emacs yank function do?

"Yanking" means reinserting text previously killed.

Here are some commands:
C-y
M-y
M-w
C-M-w


15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, 
what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, 
and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?

The dired command also list hidden files.
It's just like bash command: 
$ls -a -l
